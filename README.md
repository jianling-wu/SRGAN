# SRGAN
# This project focuses on innovating the SRGAN model. The main emphasis is on improving the training speed of the model while ensuring its performance. Key optimization points include the model's parameters and structure. 
# Specifically, the discriminator structure has been simplified by reducing some layers and introducing Depthwise separable convolutional layers. Additionally, Bottleneck attention mechanism (BAM) has been incorporated into the residual blocks of the generator. 
# These approaches had significantly enhanced the training speed of the model and improved its performance to some extent.
# The dataset used in this project is the VOC 2012 dataset, which can be downloaded from the following URL: http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/
